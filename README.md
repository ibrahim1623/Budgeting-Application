# My Personal Project

## Budgeting Application

The application will be be used by students, working individuals and just about anyone.
It will allow the user to add purchases they make into the application, which will then keep track
and calculate their monthly expenditure and patterns. This project is of interest to me because
budgeting is a big part of being a college student. An easy-to-use budgeting app would be game changer.
